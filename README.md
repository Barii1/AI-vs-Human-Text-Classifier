# AI-vs-Human-Text-Classifier
This project is a full-stack web application that classifies input text as either human-written or AI-generated using machine learning. It leverages a Logistic Regression model trained on a custom dataset with TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. The app provides a user-friendly interface for text input and instant predictions.
